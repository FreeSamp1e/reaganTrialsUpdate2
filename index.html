        Hello Reagan! Website Nick here! So here's some context: My idea for what I would do for you as a little suprise suprise while I am in Japan was a scavenger hunt. I realized you would have to go back and forth from my house to find all the clues and such, which is tedious, or it would be short and over in a few days. Using my Nextech skills I realized I could do an online scavenger hunt with a bunch of trials and such. So if you can complete these online trials before I return then you will receive a secret prize :3 Also a website is cute because it will forever be on the internet ‚ù§Ô∏è. Oh and when you finish a section let me know so I can get rid of it so you don't have to do it over and over again if you close the tab. <br> 
        <br> Version 1.1.0 <br> Update 2 <br> Sidenote: Making this makes me want to make games (with secret messages for you) so bad
        <p class = rule> <br><br>THE ONLY RULE IS NO INTERNET OR LOOKING UP ANSWERS OR USING A CALCULATOR YOU CAN ONLY USE YOUR BRAIN OR OTHER PEOPLES BRAINS. Also please don't skip questions :3<br><br> <br> <br>  NO CALCULATOR. NO LOOKING UP ANSWERS.
        </p> <br>
